# 🐟 Fish Species Prediction App

A deep learning project to classify fish species using a trained TensorFlow CNN model. Upload an image, and the model will predict the fish species from 9 possible classes.

---

 📌 Demo

Easily run the notebook in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) to predict fish species from images.

---

 📂 Classes:

* Black Sea Sprat
* Gilt-Head Bream
* Hourse Mackerel
* Red Mullet
* Red Sea Bream
* Sea Bass
* Shrimp
* Striped Red Mullet
* Trout

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/fish-species-classifier.git
cd fish-species-classifier
```

### 2️⃣ Install Requirements

```python
pip install tensorflow pillow numpy
```

### 3️⃣ Run Prediction Notebook

* Open `predict_fish.ipynb` in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook.
* Upload the `fish_model.h5` when prompted.
* Upload any fish image.
* The model will predict the fish species and display the result.

## 📊 Example Output:

```
Predicted Fish Species: Shrimp (Confidence: 92.34%)
```

---

## 🛠️ Model Details:

* Image size: 224x224 pixels
* Normalized pixel values: 0 to 1
* Architecture: CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)
